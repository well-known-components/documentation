# Introduction

Well Known Components is an initiative to create services in a consistent and scalable way, it is more a pattern and a set of conventions than a framework. Although, we created many libraries to leverage the pattern.

The pattern describes a way to organize your programs to make them easily testable and decoupled from libraries.

The main objective of it, is to empower the developers by reducing the complexity of the programs and delaying technical decisions as much as possible. Decoupling libraries from business logic, and by doing so, creating more maintainable and straight forward implementations of services, systems and applications.

We borrow concepts and inspiration from the Hexagonal Architecture.
